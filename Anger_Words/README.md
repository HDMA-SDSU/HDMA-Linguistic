The purpose of this script is to count the occurrences of high-precision anger keywords in a sample of Twitter data as a percentage of the total number of tweets. The anger keywords are: liar(s), lying, lies, hypocrite(s), hypocrisy, hypocritical, asshole(s), bullshit, fuck AND off, “fuck you”, disgrace(s), disgraced, disgraceful, “piece of shit”, “the fuck up”, piss(ed) AND off, STFU, disgusting, disgusted, disgusts, “go fuck yourself”, scum, infuriate(s), infuriating, infuriated.

These anger keywords are intended as a relative, not absolute measure of the anger expressed in a sample of tweets. Therefore, they can be used to compare the level of anger between samples or to compare against a baseline level of anger for a given population. For example, all tweets in San Diego containing the word "Republicans" on a given day could be compared to tweets containing "Democrats" and/or to tweets collected in San Diego for some neutral keywords such as "a" and "the."

The code takes as input an XLSX file or a folder of XLSX files. Each file must at least have one column containing tweet text with the header TEXT, with each tweet in a separate row. The output will be one CSV file per input file showing number and percent for each anger keyword and in total.
